# Udacity_Mapping_SLAM

##SLAM 
Robot must construct map of the environment while simulataneoulsy localizing

### Categories of SLAM Algorithms:
1. Extended Kalman Filter SLAM(EKF)
2. Sparse Extended Information Filter(SEIF)
3. Extended Information Filter(EIF)
4. FastSLAM - Particle filter with low dimesnional EKF
5. GraphSLAM - Uses constraints to relate between robot poses and the environment,
and then tries to resolve all this contsraints to create the most likely map given the data. Implementation of Graph-SLAM - RTABmap (Real Time Appearance Mapping)
