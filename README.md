# Udacity_Mapping_SLAM

## SLAM 
Robot must construct map of the environment while simulataneoulsy localizing

### Categories of SLAM Algorithms:
1. Extended Kalman Filter SLAM(EKF)
2. Sparse Extended Information Filter(SEIF)
3. Extended Information Filter(EIF)
4. FastSLAM - Particle filter with low dimesnional EKF
5. GraphSLAM - Uses constraints to relate between robot poses and the environment,
and then tries to resolve all this contsraints to create the most likely map given the data. Implementation of Graph-SLAM - RTABmap (Real Time Appearance Mapping)

  Assumption - Known Map
  Estimation - Robot's Trajectory

 - Mapping is important in dynamic environment and as well as in static                environments because sesnor measurements are always noisy and accumulate errors,    and may at times produce a low accuracy map. It's always better to map a static    environment and aim to correctthe noise to obtain a high accuracy map.
 
 - Challenges & Difficulties of Mapping
    1. Unkown map
    2. Huge Hypothesis space - Continous spread of map
    3. Size of environment
    4. Noise in sensor measurements
    5. Perceptual Ambiguity - Similar objects in environment
    6. Cycles - Traversing the same path twice back & forth
